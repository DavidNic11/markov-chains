Most of the time when this happens, nothing is wrong. But we can't be certain without checking. So several developers blow up a day of work, affecting deadlines on promised projects, trying to figure out what's causing the UI numbers to drop. 

Is there a bug preventing users from loading the page? Were they able to load the page but getting errors that would cause them to leave? Or are you about to find, after you've invested a ton of time, that the issue lies in another department entirely? 

The solution to this kind of flailing is, theoretically, more QA. But manual QA of every page before every release is not scalable in a continuous delivery world. Every day, developers are increasing the surface area that needs to be tested. 

Your testing process needs to scale while also being able to verify that every important element is visible and where it should be before every deployment. On every browser. At every common screen width. Manual QA simply isn't feasible past a certain point.

Enter visual regression testing. It's the process we use to have full confidence in every deployment while actually increasing our feature throughput.

Remember those find-the-difference games you'd see on placemats and in doctor's office magazines as a kid? Visual regression testing is like that, except instead of comparing two pictures, you're comparing your release candidate against the current page. 

Also a computer is probably faster, and more accurate, than you were as an 8-year-old. One hopes.  

Using a web UI, discovered visual differences have an approval process that includes change requests. This approval process can flow back to Github/Gitlab and become a required part of a Pull Request (or Merge Request).

You may already be testing with some common React methods, such as Jest unit tests, browser automation with Playwright, or React Testing Library integration tests. While all of these are useful, they only test code and markup. They don't test the web page in the same way it's consumed by a user: visually. 

Here are the major advantages to using visual regression testing instead of other common React testing methods. 

By comparing the visual output, we create a test that closely mimics what a real user will see. If CSS styling positions your call to action outside of the user's view, visual regression testing will pick up on it where other methods will not. 

Positioned elements outside viewport

Control elements overlapped by other elements

Incorrect z-indexing

Padding and margin changes

Cross browser issues and styling incompatibility

Visual regression testing alerts you of any of these problems before it goes into production, which gives you the ability to spot and fix UX issues before they ever encounter a real live user. 

You can include QA, UI, UX and product owners early in the review process, during every feature PR. With modern tooling like Percy, those non-technical stakeholders can provide feedback and approve changes in an easy to use web-based interface, similar to how code is reviewed.

This improves developer output by decreasing context switching. Issues are addressed while the code is still fresh, not a week or more later in a separate QA process.

While visual regression testing can't replace the QA process, it enhances it significantly. Visual regression testing spots what's changed and submits it to a dev for review. Verification takes a fraction of the time it used to - while increasing quality.

Visual regression testing adds an extra but parallel step in the review process. On teams with embedded designers or product owners, those people can review the visual diff.

Otherwise, reviewing visual diffs can be done by the same developer peers that review the code, though we'd still recommend reaching out to the original designer or change requestor on complicated changes.

While you can roll your own solution in your CI/CD process, thatâ€™s a lot of work. Our favorite existing service for visual regression testing is Percy.io, owned by Browserstack.

With Percy, all you have to do is define which pages or components you want to test. Percy manages all of the screenshots and provides a website for change review. We like the following things about Percy: 

Owned by Browserstack, single account for all browser testing

Unlimited accounts so designers and Product Owners can get involved

Web UI allows review by non-technical stakeholders

Can test at multiple screen widths you define (mobile, desktop, etc.)

Can test on multiple browsers including Chrome and Safari

Loads and tests pages using a yaml config file

Can interact with page elements (e.g. input text and submit form)

Basic snapshot testing does allow you to run a Javascript command for DOM manipulation, clicking a button for example. However, this can feel a bit clunky, especially if you need to write out complex user scripts.

If you outgrow the capabilities of snapshot or Storybook testing, you can move on to integrations with browser automation tools including Puppeteer or Playwright.

With your chosen browser automation tool, in this case Playwright, load and interact with the page as desired. You can then pass the page over to the Percy integration to send your test snapshot.
